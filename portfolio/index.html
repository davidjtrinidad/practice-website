In the meantime, please subscribe to the stock notifications and try to be quick when you get an email. There are more people subscribing than frames being added each time and it's first come, first served! If you miss out please remember to subscribe again to get another chance the next time, your stock subscription needs to be renewed after each email!</p>
	
	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

	<p>The Helix is a new breed of FPV quadcopter which integrates the design process of both the air frame and the flight electronics</p>

	<p>By keeping an obsessive focus on enthusiast level performance, but freeing ourselves from the need to support the vast array of third party electronics, we have created a package which offers a unique blend of performance, durability, features, ease and versatility.</p>

		<h3>REQUIRED</h3>

	<h3>RELATED PRODUCTS</h3>
	
	<p>Please see related items to the right.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>FPV camera - HS1177 (top connector) or Runcam Swift/Owl</li>
			<li>RC receiver - No larger than FrSky X4R-SB</li>
			<li>FPV antenna - TBS Triumph</li>
			<li>Motors - 2204-2206 class motors to suit prop size</li>
			<li>ESCs - Aikon 30A or Littlebee 20A</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Please note, we highly recommend using one of the ESC choices above, or something the same physical size. Larger ESCs will function but are not optimal!</p>
	
	<p>Standard build tools and supplies, such as silicon wire, XT-60, heat-shrink etc. will also be necessary to complete the kit.</p>

	<h3>FEATURES</h3>

	<p>The Helix is <strong>compact</strong>, the centre measures 34mm across and the gap between the two electronics tiers is 10mm. The FPV camera is held at a set angle by carbon plates which follow the contours of the camera to offer full protection with the minimum size and weight. The ZX5 is 200mm motor to motor and the carbon weighs 58g, the ZX6 is 230mm motor to motor and the carbon weighs 62g. Camera plates supporting 30, 45 and 60 degrees are included in every kit.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <strong>durable</strong>, using a 2.5mm base plate and a 2mm top plate, along with the proven strength of the Warpquad arm profile in 4mm carbon. Where it's most needed in the centre section we use grade 12.9 high tensile alloy steel, elsewhere to save weight all hardware is 7075 aluminium. Durability is comparable to our Alien frames.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <strong>easy</strong>, building the kit is simpler and more streamlined than any other frame in this class. The ESCs, Lipo, buzzer, LED strips and RC receiver all connect directly to the flight controller. The FPV camera and antenna connect directly to the VTX. The flight controller and VTX are connected by one cable for power and one for serial data.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <strong>polished</strong>, all carbon plates are chamfered, injection moulded fairings protect your ESCs from prop strikes, custom machined aluminium clamps keep antennas secure and in the optimal position.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <strong>precise</strong>, the flight controller is fully soft mounted, enlarged holes allow the standoffs to pass completely through to the carbon below leaving the PCB floating on a self-adhesive die cut foam rubber gasket. Isolating the flight electronics from vibrations gives the most crisp and responsive flight characteristics possible.</p>

	<h3>GOPRO MOUNTING</h3>
	
	<p>The Helix is just as comfortable tearing up the track as it is bouncing off trees in a park. To be truly versatile we wanted to mount a GoPro without compromising.</p>
	
	<p>Moving the FPV camera forward and dropping it over the front of the VTX, our dedicated HD camera plates position the GoPro at 45 degrees of tilt and perfectly in the centre. By keeping the weight of the camera as low as possible, handling characteristics and performance are maintained at the highest level. Our HD camera plates are included in the kit by default.</p>

	<h3>ELECTRONICS</h3>

	<p>The Helix is <strong>advanced</strong>, the combined PDB and flight controller offers Betaflight support on an STM32 F3 with a SPI based MPU6000 gyro. Blackbox support, direct Lipo input, LED strip outputs and a front mounted buzzer are included. The VTX is combined with an OSD and microphone as well as a rock solid 5V output for your camera. Changing between all 40 channels, as well as 25mw, 200mw and 500mw output power, is all available via menus in the OSD. LED strips and an external USB to serial adapter for flashing the OSD are all provided.</p>

	<p>The Helix is <strong>powerful</strong>, 6S batteries are fully supported. All of the electronics provided are rated to 40V input to cope with extreme voltage spikes from high end motors and ESCs. No extra filtering or special requirements, just obscene power right out of the box.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <stron>clean</stron>, on the VTX we used cascaded switching and linear regulators with additional filtering components. The image is crystal clear under even the most aggressive 6S flying, motor noise in your video feed is a thing of the past. The through-hole SMA connector is a tested and proven design, adding strain relief to the antenna translates any levering forces in to pulling forces where the connector is at its strongest.</p>
	
	<p>The Helix is <strong>ready</strong>, the required cables between the flight controller and VTX are included, all electronics come flashed and ready to run with sensible defaults.</p>
